Stratigraphic &amp; Geomorphic Forward Modelling Framework.

The website embeds documentation and examples on how to use LECODE and its associated framework (SGFM).

The SGFM framework is a new numerical approach for simulating geomorphic and stratigraphic processes that combines open-channel flow with non-uniform sediment transport law, and semi-empirical diffusive mass wasting.

It is designed to facilitate modelling of surface processes across multiple space and time scales, and under a variety of environmental and tectonic conditions. The physics of open-channel flow is primarily based on an adapted Lagrangian formulation of shallow-water equations. The interaction between flow and surface geology is performed by a non-uniform total-load sediment transport law. Additional hillslope processes are simulated using a semi empirical methods based on a diffusion approach.

LECODE is the implementation of this combined approach. In this code, the resolution of flow dynamics is made on a triangulated grid automatically mapped and adaptively remeshed over a regular orthogonal stratigraphic mesh. These new methods reduce computational time while preserving stability and accuracy of the physical solutions.
