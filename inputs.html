  &lt;!-- Definition of stratigraphic grid 
	and flow computational grid (TIN) 
  --&gt;
  &lt;struct-Mesh-TIN&gt;

    &lt;!-- Stratigraphic grid parameters --&gt;
    &lt;Strata_grid&gt;

      &lt;!-- Name of the basement node file and its path.
			The path is from the main input file location. 
			This ASCII file provides for each line the following information:
				- node IDs
				- X coordinates in metres (this axis has a West to East orientation)
				- Y coordinates in metres (this axis has a South to West orientation)
				- Z coordinates in metres
			In addition the nodes should be defined in increasing order starting
			from the Sout-West corner and going first along the X axis (West to East).
	   	--&gt;
      &lt;StrataGrid&gt;data/gbr_N.nodes&lt;/StrataGrid&gt;

      &lt;!-- Number of nodes along the X axis (West to East direction). 
			It should conform with basement node file definition.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;GridX&gt;330&lt;/GridX&gt;

      &lt;!-- Number of nodes along the Y axis (South to West direction). 
			It should conform with basement node file definition.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;GridY&gt;330&lt;/GridY&gt;

      &lt;!-- Grid spacing (in metres), defining the stratigraphic grid resolution.
			It should conform with basement node file definition.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;GridSpace unit="m"&gt;500&lt;/GridSpace&gt;

      &lt;!-- South West corner X coordinate expressed in metres.
			It should conform with basement node file definition.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;GridXo unit="m"&gt;305250.0&lt;/GridXo&gt;

      &lt;!-- South West corner Y coordinate expressed in metres.
			It should conform with basement node file definition.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;GridYo unit="m"&gt;8220250.0&lt;/GridYo&gt;

    &lt;/Strata_grid&gt;

    &lt;!-- Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) definition. 
		The TIN is used to compute the flow surface evolution and is
		automatically generated during simulation to ensure better resolution
		calculation in places most subject to potential flow processes.
	  --&gt;
    &lt;TIN_refine&gt;
      &lt;!-- Highest resolution for the TIN in metres.
			The value should be equal or higher than the stratigraphic grid
			spacing defined above in parameter &lt;GridSpace&gt;. In addition this
			value needs to be a multiple of the grid spacing.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;HighRes unit="m"&gt;500&lt;/HighRes&gt;

      &lt;!-- Lowest resolution for the TIN in metres.
			The value should be equal or higher than the highest resolution
			defined above in parameter &lt;HighRes&gt;. In addition this
			value needs to be a multiple of the grid spacing.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;LowRes unit="m"&gt;1000&lt;/LowRes&gt;

      &lt;!-- Parameter used to fill all of the depressions on the stratigraphic 
			grid topography and to remove the flat and hole areas. This is a 
			pre-processing step used to ensure continuous flow from each grid 
			cell. This parameter is an incremental step used during the depression 
			filling process and is expressed in metres. 
			
			Note: in case the depression filling algorithm is not required for
			your simulation set the value to 0.0. 
			
			Ref: Planchon, O., and F., Darboux (2001). A fast, simple and versatile 
			algorithm to fill the depres- sions of digital elevation models. 
			Catena, 46, 159â€“176.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;StepFill unit="m"&gt;0.001&lt;/StepFill&gt;

      &lt;!-- Flow accumulation operation performs a cumulative count of the number 
			of pixels that naturally drain into outlets. This operation is performed 
			several time during the simulation to adjust and adapt the TIN grid 
			resolution depending on the areas of highest flow accumulation values.
			This parameter sets the minimum flow accumulation value over which the 
			high resolution (parameter &lt;HighRes&gt; defined above) is used to generate
			the TIN resolution. For areas with flow accumulation values below this 
			parameter the &lt;LowRes&gt; parameter is used.
			
			Note: the minimum value for the flow accumulation is 1. 
      --&gt;
      &lt;FlowAcc&gt;10&lt;/FlowAcc&gt;

    &lt;/TIN_refine&gt;

    &lt;!-- Specify the model boundary types for the stratigraphic grid.
		 For each border the following values could be set:
		 	- 0 for infinite flat boundary, 
		 	- 1 to insert a wall and prevent sediment transfert and fluid   
		 		loss outside the simulated domain,
		 	- 2 for extended slope. 
	  --&gt;
    &lt;Boundary&gt;
      &lt;!-- North boundary 
		  --&gt;
      &lt;North&gt;2&lt;/North&gt;

      &lt;!-- South boundary 
		  --&gt;
      &lt;South&gt;0&lt;/South&gt;

      &lt;!-- East boundary 
		  --&gt;
      &lt;East&gt;0&lt;/East&gt;

      &lt;!-- West boundary 
		  --&gt;
      &lt;West&gt;0&lt;/West&gt;

    &lt;/Boundary&gt;

    &lt;!-- Control of the restart functionality. Model can be set 
		to restart from a previous simulation step.
		
		Note: This element is optional and only required to perform
		a simulation based on a previously simulation.
	  --&gt;
    &lt;Restart&gt;

      &lt;!-- Name of the output folder from the previous run. 
			
			Note: it corresponds to the &lt;OutputDirectory&gt; parameter defined
			in the previous XmL input file that needs to be restarted.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;RestartFolder&gt;path/to/previous/output/Folder&lt;/RestartFolder&gt;

      &lt;!-- The restart iteration number is informing the code on which file ID needs
			to be ran from the previous simulations. Depending on how the &lt;CheckPointing&gt;
			parameters were set (if set) the software is outputing a serie of checkpointing
			files at given time steps (See &lt;CheckPointing&gt; parameter for additional definition).
			These files are located in the runfiles directory under the folder specified in the
			&lt;RestartFolder&gt; element above and are named "checkpoint.&lt;RestartIt&gt;.pID.h5" where 
			&lt;RestartIt&gt; corresponds to a given &lt;LayerTime&gt; iteration number and pID to a given 
			processor ID number
			
			Note: You will need to ensure that the restart iteration number corresponds to the 
			&lt;startTime&gt; value of the simulation that you are currentlty defining. 
			
			Note: In case you did not set the &lt;CheckPointing&gt; parameter in the previous simulation
			the code is generating the check pointing files just for the end of your previous run
			which means that you should have only one &lt;RestartIt&gt; number and that the new simulation
			&lt;startTime&gt; parameter will be equal to the &lt;endTime&gt; parameter of the previous one. 
		  --&gt;
      &lt;RestartIt&gt;40&lt;/RestartIt&gt;

      &lt;!-- Number of processors used in the last simulation. This number could be retreived by 
			looking at the check pointing files located in the runfiles directory under the folder 
			specified in the &lt;RestartFolder&gt; element above. The number will be equal to the biggest
			ID of the checkpoint.&lt;RestartIt&gt;.pID.h5 file names plus 1.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;ProcNb&gt;2&lt;/ProcNb&gt;

    &lt;/Restart&gt;

  &lt;/struct-Mesh-TIN&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- Definition of simulation and
	processes time step.
  --&gt;
  &lt;struct-time&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- General time controlling parameters --&gt;
    &lt;Time&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Delaration of simulation starting time in years. 
			
			Note: the start time parameter accepts both positive and 
				negative value to represent time before present.
	 	  --&gt;
      &lt;startTime unit="a"&gt;-120000&lt;/startTime&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Delaration of simulation ending time in years. Obviously, this 
			value needs to be greater than the starting time one.
			
			Note: the end time parameter accepts both positive and 
				negative value to represent time before present.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;endTime unit="a"&gt;-110000&lt;/endTime&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Sedimentary layers are recorded through time and each layer
			corresponds to a specific time interval. This time interval 
			is expressed in years. 
			
			Note: The smaller the layer time, the higher the temporal resolution
			of the sedimentary record will be. However it will also impact the 
			simulation computational time so compromise needs to be made.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;layerTime unit="a"&gt;1000&lt;/layerTime&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Time at which a new output is generated. The value should be at least 
			equal to the layer time interval and could be set as a multiple of this 
			parameter. In case of simulation creating large output files it is recommend 
			to set this value to 4 or 5 times the &lt;layerTime&gt; one.
			
			Note: Consider increasing the output time interval to gain save some
			computational time and space on your remote or local machine.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;outputTime unit="a"&gt;2000&lt;/outputTime&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Flow time sampling interval expressed in years. It controls how often
			flow walkers are released from their sources. The sources are defined in
			the &lt;Sources&gt; element and correspond to rivers or gravity currents flowing
			within the simulation domain.
			
			Note: The value should be a factor of the layer time interval.
				In case the simulation has no sources declared set this value to a large number.
		  --&gt;

      &lt;!-- Rain time sampling interval expressed in years. It controls how often
			flow walkers are released from rainfall grid. The rainfall is defined in
			the &lt;RainfallGrid&gt; element.
			
			Note: The value should be a factor of the layer time interval.
				In case the simulation has no rain declared set this value to a large number.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;rainInterval unit="a"&gt;500&lt;/rainInterval&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Slope diffusion time sampling interval expressed in years. It controls how 
			often slope diffusion algorithm is used to smooth top layer newly deposited
			sediments. 
			
			Note: The value should be a factor of the layer time interval.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;SlopeInterval unit="a"&gt;250&lt;/SlopeInterval&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- The sampling interval is expressed in years and controls how 
			often sea level fluctuations, displacements are updated within the simulation.
			
			Note: The value should be a factor of the layer time interval.
		  --&gt;
      &lt;samplingInterval unit="a"&gt;250&lt;/samplingInterval&gt;
      
    &lt;/Time&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- The software is not able to restart a simulation from a given time step using the
		output files generated. To make it possible the &lt;CheckPointing&gt; element needs to be 
		set. This element enable the creation of a series of restarting files located in the  
		runfiles directory under the folder specified in the &lt;OutputDirectory&gt; element. These 
		files are named "checkpoint.tID.pID.h5" where tID corresponds to a particular time   
		iteration step and pID to a given processor ID number.
		
		Note: This element is optional.
		
		Note: By default the code is going to generate a checkpoint file at the end of the
		simulation.
	  --&gt;
    &lt;CheckPointing&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Frequency at which check pointing is performed. This integer is directly linked to the 
			layer time interval element and corresponding simulation time for a given checkpoint file
			is retreived by multiplying the frequency ID number (defined as tID in explanation above) 
			by the layer time interval and by adding the simulation starting time.
		  --&gt;	
      &lt;Frequency&gt;10&lt;/Frequency&gt;	
      
    &lt;/CheckPointing&gt;

    &lt;SeaLevelFluctuations&gt;
      &lt;!-- Name of the sea-level fluctuations file and its associated path.
			The path is from the main input file location. 
			This ASCII file provides for each line the following information:

	 		required to have at least one material defined. 
	 		
	 	Note: The total number of materials is set to 10 in the default version of LECODE. 
	 		If the simulation requires more grain sizes you will need to change the default
